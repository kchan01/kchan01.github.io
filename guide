To Do:

Overall Format
1) Search page should not be linked on the navbar, but rather linked to search bar button.
The search bar button will be next to every search bar.

2) Put a search bar with search button at the top right on every page.

3) Link that search button next to the top right button to the search page.

4) Remove the lyrics tab and have it only linked to the search page.

5) Have all navbar buttons give visual feedback when on that webpage (see web design website).
  Maybe have part of the bar highlight where your page is link tabbed. (flex box?)



Home Page
1) Put search button next to search box

2) Turn home button into logo? (aligned left on top navbar)

3) Align center the bottom navbar buttons, but social media will be icon buttons that are aligned right.

4) Optional: Text pop up when hovering over home page images.


Search Page
1) Build it (design might be way to complicated, maybe just easier to list a bunch of songs with their images).


Artist Page
1) Build it (is it feasible with the current design?)


Lyrics Page
1) Don't have lyrics tab at top and instead, link the lyrics page in the search page.

2) Optional: Image of song and or album behind the title/name header, or even in the background of the entire lyric page.

3) Optional: Fix how the text overflows into the next line when the window changes.
